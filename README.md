Stochastic simulations of the mechanical forces transmitted within cellular adhesions between neighboring cells (Adherens Junctions) and between cells and the extracellular matrix (Focal Adhesions) developed in Shoyer et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 2023 [doi: 10.1073/pnas.2316456120]. The model links molecular properties of force-bearing adhesion proteins, determined from single molecule experiments in the literature, to the force transmission properties of these sub-cellular adhesion structures, which are important for understanding important cell behaviors including cell migration. A user guide is provided as a .pdf file. Please see the publication, including its extensive supplementary material, for complete detailes, includinmg model formulation, parameter selection, model implementation, and model analysis and results.
